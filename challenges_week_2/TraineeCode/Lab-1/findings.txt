The code shows that `AccountManager1` directly accesses and modifies the protected variables of the `Account` class, which bypasses the property setters and getters, thereby violating encapsulation and ignoring business logic such as adding the bank code to the account number and calculating interest on the balance. As a result, the displayed data is incomplete and incorrect. In contrast, `AccountManager2` uses the public properties of the `Account` class, ensuring that validation and business rules (like prefixing the account number and adding interest to the balance) are properly applied. This highlights the importance of using properties to maintain encapsulation, data integrity, and correct program behavior.
